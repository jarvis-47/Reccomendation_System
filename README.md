# Recommendation System for Online Movie Platform

This project demonstrates the creation of a recommendation engine for an emerging online movie platform. The model utilizes film ratings from 98 Clemson University students and 280 anonymous users. Three algorithms were considered: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Matrix Factorization (SVD), and a memory-based method. Of these, the Matrix Factorization approach proved superior.

## Key Points:

* The aim was to guide users through vast digital media choices, enhancing user experience.
* Addressed the 'cold start' issue for new users/movies by integrating historical data and an item-based strategy.
* Dataset: Ratings for 50 films, scaled from 1 to 5. Unwatched movies were nullified.
* Methodology: Leveraged collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.
* Performance: Achieved an average prediction error of 0.32.
* For movies not in the initial survey, predictions were supplemented using historical data.

Recommendations from this system can amplify customer lifetime value and improve retention, offering substantial benefits for entertainment and retail businesses. Detailed findings and metrics can be viewed in the complete report.
